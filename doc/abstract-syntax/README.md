# Abstract Syntax

This directory contains information about the abstract syntax of the front-end
language for ACL2 and APT.

The `...-uml.txt` files are textual UML diagrams of abstract syntax constructs,
written in [PlantML](https://plantuml.com). The `...-uml.png` are the
corresponding graphics diagrams, generated by PlantUML, but included under
version control for convenience for now.
